( Tank by The Seatbelts )

I think it's time to blow this thing

Get everybody and their stuff together,

Okay, 3..2..1..
Let's JAM!

I like those shades, man.

I like everything you've got.

Lookin' to some big bucks?

I think you would fit right in here.

Herbal Medicine Shop

Do you know the
first rule of combat?

Shoot them before they shoot you.

Quite an elaborate way
to get acquainted.

I had no idea the legendary
Lady Luck was still alive...

... Poker Alice, Queen of Hearts.

They tell tales about you on every
asteroid from here to TJ.

If Alice was still alive,
she would be over 200 years old.

Considering, you're looking pretty good.
Hottest granny in the star system.

Poker Alice never lost a game,
and she never cheated.

-She was just a born winner.
- Maybe...

Maybe that's just part of the legend?

I understand that you've accrued
quite a large debt.

Would you rather deal with the galactic police,
or me, Miss Queen of Hearts?

A prophecy?

So Charlie says,
"Only hands can wash hands."

"If you want to receive, you have to give."
Something like that.

I wish I could remember the exact words.

Anyway, I think Charlie
is telling us to "just do it".

What do you make of it?

Somehow, I don't think Charlie Parker
would be quoting Goethe.

Come on, it's just a dream I had,
lighten up.

I have a feeling that dream is going
to suck up our last...

...5,000 woolongs.

I'm really sorry to mention this...

...no smoking in here.

You better not play here.
Your eyes are too sharp.

They'll kick us out if you win too much.

Thanks, mom.
But if you didn't want me to win...

... you shouldn't have
brought me here.

Say your prayers.

Thanks for the tip.

Queen makes 21.

You mind if I join a game?

He's the one.

That's 21.

The target will sit at your blackjack
table, and lose all of his money.

Of course, you will use your skills to
help him with that.

And, he'll give you his last chip as a tip.
A token for his lovely dealer.

That's great,
what about it?

Put that chip in my hands, and all those
ugly debts of yours will disappear.

The final hand.

What a shame. It appears I'm not skillful
and I'm not lucky either.

Then what are you?

I seem to be very generous.

Another Blackjack.

You cleaned me out.
All but this one chip.

I think I'll keep it as a souvenir.

Hey? Wait, hey!

Come back here!

Hey, you!

What happened to your generosity?

You're messing up the whole plan!

Huh?

Don't play stupid. You were supposed
to give me the last chip!

You're pretty brass.

You cheated the whole game,
and I didn't say a word!

Crowd:
Did you hear that!?

No wonder I'm broke!

Unbelievable!

Just give me the damn chip!

Can you come with me to the office, sir?
We have some questions.

Like what?

Bad move.

You punk... oh!

Come on guys...

I like the fitness program here.
It's a good workout.

Okay, showtime!

We've got a problem!

Another fight!

Heh heh.
A fight, huh?

Oh, Spike...

Yes!

Jet.

I told you not to win too much...

That's not it!

We've gotta split, fast! Come on!

I haven't cashed these in yet!

HEY!!

He doesn't have it.
The chip he was carrying is a fake.

Neither you nor your boss were told
why we cooked up this plan.

But there was a reason,
and that chip is crucial.

If it chip falls into police hands...

We're finished!

Boss, we still can't find the girl.

Track her down!

Put a price on her pretty head!

Wait a minute!

I brought you guys back here,
I should get a reward for that.

Why are you locking me up?!

Stupid dog.

My dog thinks you smells like money,
and I have the very same impression.

Well, get over it!

Hey Jet, how much did you win
on those slots?

It must have been 200K,
minimum.

And who made you lose
the whole pile?

200K is chump change.

It's nothing compared to what I've lost...

It's peanuts and you're blaming
the wrong person!

Right, you're little zip craft
should sell at least for 400K.

You brought this upon yourselves.

If you had given me that chip,
there wouldn't have been no problem.

Chip?

Yeah chip!
Are you deaf?

Eww...
That's disgusting.

Gordon will pay a fortune for that.
More then your little brain can imagine.

So, why don't we call him?
What do you say?

I don't know any one named "Gordon,"
and even if I did...

...you don't expect for me to buy that
phony story, do you?

Wait a minute!

Come on Ein,
let's go.

Were are you going?
Come back here!

It's a chip.

Of course it's a chip.

Not the poker chip, dummy.
There's another chip inside that chip.

A microchip.

HIYA AMIGOs!
You ready for some bounty info?

BIGSHOT, cowboys is
coming your way!

- Woe...
- So, who's up first this week?

A pretty poker player that's headed for
the pokey. She doesn't look it, but...

- Hey, Spike!
- ...she's a tough cookie. Faye Valentine.

And the bounty is a whopping
6 million woolongs!

- Yo! Hey, Jet!
- Shucks, howdy!

Happy hunting all you, cowboys!

I've been waiting for you.

First off, I didn't run away.
My ship was hijacked.

I believe you, of course.
Where are you?

An old fishing ship at the gate.

And they have the control chip, Gordon.

So hurry up and--

What do you want?

Well, we were thinking about you,
and had a little change of heart.

Why lock up a fine young lady like you
up in a place like this?

You creeps aren't getting any ideas,
are you?

On the contrary, we're taking you
someplace where you will be well protected.

Oh, and where would that be?

The police station.

You were right, 200K is chump change
compared to your price...

...Faye Valentine.

I don't believe this.
Did they put a bounty on me?

Six million fat woolongs.

Six million,
is that all they're offering?

Just how much money
do you owe, anyway...?

Come on, have a heart!
Take me anywhere but the police!

They're the only ones who
will play your bounty.

I can't be stuck in one place for long,
it will kill me!

My whole family is like that.

Yeah, right.

We're "Roamanies". For eons we've
wandered the stars ...

... looking for love.
It's our way.

Huh?

You don't know anything, do you?
Roamanies are Gypsies!

And do you know what we call
someone like you?

A "Gorgio", that means a "bumpkin".

Who doesn't know
which way is up!

"Gorgio."
I like that.

Oww! The wilds are calling me...
You can't keep me locked up!

Save it for the police.

Come on, Jet,
let's get out of here.

Fine. I'm not gonna run away.
At least uncuff one hand!

I can't even go to
the bathroom this way!

Man, you're a real talker,
aren't you?

Spike, my friend.
That girl is money in the bank.

Yeah, no penalty for early withdraw.

It's just Charlie said in my dream, "If you
want to receive, you have to give."

See Spike you got to listen to your dreams.
That is how you find your dream girl.

Ow...

Who's that??

I'm not sure who you are,
and I don't really give a damn...

...you have my chip,
and I want it back.

Well, I'm not sure who you are,
and I'm not giving you anything...

...are we done now?

It's just a poker chip.
It has no value to you.

We have become quite fond of it,
and we know what it's worth.

Three years ago, SIT developed a
decryption program called "Crypt-Breaker"...

...Rumor has it,
that shortly after completion ...

... the programmer turned up dead,
and the program disappeared...

...a program with advanced artificial intelligence.

It can decrypt and unlock
virtually any security code.

But the catch is, the program itself
is encoded. So whoever has it ...

... needs the key to open it.
The "key to the key" so to speak.

They say the cops and the ISSP
special forces have been searching...

... every corner of the asteroids for it.

I guess they never thought to
look in a casino ...

Or even if they did, who would suspect
a humble poker chip?

Not bad, you've done your homework.

I used to be with ISSP special forces myself.
In another lifetime.

Of course a casino is a perfect place to
launder large sums of stolen money.

You had the right idea...

You've just chose the wrong day.

Now it's only right we do our civic duty
and give it to the police....

... sense as you pointed out,
it's worthless to us.

It's not worthless
if I pay you for it.

300 million woolongs...?

Nah, I'll go easy on you,
make it 30 million.

Cheap, for a magic key, huh?

Alright.

Jet: Okay, 6 million turns into 30 million.

Spike: Our little nest egg is growing.

Jet: Just be ready.
Don't get caught off-guard.

Spike: Okey dokey.

(Dog begins growling)

Shhh!!

Stupid dog.
(Dog starts barking)

Sellers who wants cash
up front is rare these days.

Yeah? I guess I'm just
an old-fashioned guy.

Beautiful.

Now we'll both count to three.

Then we'll release the magnetic field
and move it up towards you.

At the exact same time...

You will toss the chip carefully to us.

Spike: No problem.

I'm trusting you, pal.

Confirm that we have
the chip, then destroy them.

Right.

Let's do it!

One.

Two.

Three.

Hey!

Youse suppose to OPEN the hanger!

Huh?

Hey, "Gorgio."

Hello, "Roamani."

Bye!

Don't let go!
Fire!!

Shit!

Jet, get me outta here!

Alright!

Sink them!
Destroy all of them!

No way!

She reversed polarity on
one of the missiles!

It's coming back around!

She beat me again.

All this thing is good for now is one bet.

Might as well use it.
We're starting from square one.

In the background:
"Hey, the dealer is cheating!"

Jet: This sucks!

This world is a mess!

Economic recession.
Kids blowing their mind.

Spike: You've been reading
the paper again?

Take a look at the Bebop.

It's a bigger mess then that.

Jet: Bah, that's nothing.

Check out this news report.

Intergalactic terrorist.
They want to blow up Ganymede.

Spike: Huh?

Jet: They're "Environmental Protectionist".

Spike: Perfect, you can get rid of this
fur ball you call a dog.

Jet: Next episode:
"Gateway Shuffle."

Spike: Man, I'm losing it.
