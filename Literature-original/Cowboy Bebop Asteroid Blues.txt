(Church bells tolling)

( Tank by The Seatbelts )

I think it's time to blow this thing

Get everybody and their stuff together,

Okay, 3..2..1..
Let's JAM!

Hey, Spike!

It's ready!

I'm just about finished.

What's cooking?

SPECIAL "Bell Peppers in Beef."
(Qng-jiao-rou-si)

Asimov Solensan.
He's is our next target.

Ah, listen, Jet...

This guy is a major player in the syndicate,
he operates all around the asteroids.

You said "Bell Peppers in Beef"...

His name is Asimov Solensan.
Are you listening to me?!

There's no beef in here ...

...So you wouldn't call it "Bell Peppers
in Beef" now would you?

Yes, I would.

Well, it's NOT!

It is when you're broke, alright?

What happened to the million woolong
reward we got from that last guy!?

The repair bill for
for that cruiser you wrecked...

...and the one
for that shop you trashed...

...and the medical bill
from the cop you injured...

KILLED THE DOUGH!

Now, three days ago, there was a shootout
between his group and a rival syndicate.

He killed his own guys,
and then took off like the wind.

Word is he's hiding out
with some sweet thing in Tijuana.

TJ, that place is for small fries.

Yeah, well this small fry is worth
two and a half million.

I don't feel like it.

... Speaking of beef they say in TJ...

...the carnitas are out of this world...

"Attention, please. We will be arriving
at our destination shortly."

"Please prepare for departure."

"Please line up single file."

"Please proceed along the yellow line"

"Caution is advised at all times.

"Please through the gate with
credit sensors to debit mode."

"We hope you had a pleasant flight."

I'll head over there after
hit up the cops for some clues.

Alright.
Then I'll check in with Old Man Bull.

You think you can trust that old codger?

(Spike whistling soulful western tune.)

Nice tune,
real easy.

THIEF!

This again?
Sonofabitch!

Taking my money like that,
you cheating dogs!

Why the only reason you can
even live here is because...

...of what I've done!
I busted my tail to dig that gate!

For crimminy sakes...

You always say same thing
when you're losing.

We all dug that gate together,
and you know it.

That we did...
We worked like there was no tomorrow...

And what do we got to show for it...!

Gimme a beer.

And I'll have a Bloody Mary.
In fact, make it a double.

I've got the vodka, but I'm afraid
I'm fresh out of tomato juice.

I'm sure there's one can
in the back room...

I'll check.

Premium "RED-EYE."

You're a buyer, you know the score.
Check it out.

Is that real... " BLOODY-EYE"?

I'm gonna need a little proof.
Let's have a demonstration.

(His heart starts pounding louder)

Yeah, keep those eyes open!

This is real mystic and all, but do you
have anything to eat here?

I see...

The red-eyed coyote will appear
at the zone north today at the far end of town.

That is what I see.

A red-eyed coyote, north of town...

- You, "Swimming Bird."
- Huh?

The "Swimming Bird" will meet a woman.

The "Bird" will be hunted
by this woman... and then...

...death.

One more time.

What's that?

I was killed once before...

By a woman.

You take women too lightly,
my friend.

On the contrary.
Catch you later.

Wakantanka guide his spirit.

Presidente, eh? Think I'll have some,
on the house.

(Outside car screeches to a halt.)

Hmm?

Damn. Just look at this,
Asimov went berzerk.

No joke. We gotta take care of him
before the cops move in.

Maybe we should let the
cops deal with him?

As long as he's using that
red eye on himself.

You can't beat him..

We've got too. If we don't get that "BLOODY-EYE" back.

Trust me,
we all be twisting in the wind.

Maybe so... huh!

Yo.

Tell me some more.

I am starving...

So you're hungry too,
huh baby...?

You know, it's better just to
leave the water running.

So you don't clog the drain.

(Spike leaves whistling same tune)

- Oops.
- Sorry!

Thank you...

- Excuse me...
- Hmm?

It's a hot dog!

Yeah, I can see that.
Just keep it.

Sorry,

... my stomach took over my brain.
It does that sometimes.

Nice ship.

Yeah, it's a blast from the past.

I've had it for ten years.

It looks like it's been around.

I guess you could say we've
done some traveling.

I'm actually a traveling performer.

I can't tell when you're joking
or when you're not.

Yeah, I hear that a lot.

Ever been to Mars?

I was born on Mars.

I hear they have everything there.

Not like here, there's parks and festivals,
and the people are happy there...

...it must be a great place to live.

Sure, if you're rich.

Then I'm sure we'll be quite happy.

Planning to escape to Mars, huh?

Go ahead and run.
How far do you think you'll get?

Who are you?

I'm just an old-fashioned cowboy.

You're a bounty hunter.

Yeah, that's right.

And you're after us?

Your boyfriend is sick.
He is a small fry.

I don't bother with his type.

A wise decision.

Now, who is the small fry!

Asimov! That's enough!
Let him go!

Adios, cowboy.

Why did you stop me?

He would have been dead
in another minute.

I wanted to see him die.

Asimov please,
this has to stop...

I think you liked him,
didn't you?

You left me there for so long Asimov,
I was just waiting for you to pick me up...

Let's go Asimov, as you promised.
I want to get out of this life.

I know I can be happy on Mars...

Having ourselves a little nap, huh?

I had a sweet dream.

That's heartwarming.

Then you can go ahead and finish your
dream back on the Bebop.

I'm cashing in my chips on this one.

It's impossible to catch the guy.
There's no way to win it.

When Asimov left his syndicate,
he snuck some stuff out with him.

Serious brew.
This stuff is a total mind frag.

It's a new kind of eye spray
the syndicate cooked up.

Very pure. Takes 2 months
to make 1 vial.

Our boy took off with every drop,
which made him rather unpopular.

They keep sending hit teams after him,
but all they get back are corpses.

It seems Asimov has been pumping up...

by doing the stuff, himself.
It's called "BLOODY-EYE".

No kidding. You know they're planning
on going to Mars.

Mars?

But before that,
they've gotta sell THESE.

Is that what I think it is?

Yeah, I grabbed it out
from his pocket.

You...
met him?

Yeah, so to speak.

He nailed you, huh?

The red-eyed coyote will appear at the
zone north today at far end of town.

This again?
Goddamn sonofabitch!

Taking my money like that,
you cheating dogs!

Why the only reason you can eat here
is because of what I have done!

...I busted my tail to plant those crops
along with my 2 good buddies!

We're the buddies
you're talking about.

Yeah, sure,
that we are...

We planted those seeds like
there was no tomorrow...

You were always planting "seeds"
of a different kind, though!

Huh?

So, do you have any Bloody Mary's?

I only have beer.

I've got tomato juice.

How much?

30 million woolongs.

For 50 packs.

15 million woolongs...

I'm in a hurry.

I've got other customers.

Show me.

Lookin' for this?

Do you know how much
YOU'RE worth?

What?

Two point five million woolongs,
that's your bounty.

I said you were a small fry.

You look surprised.

You look ridiculous in that outfit.

I thought you weren't after my bounty?

There is no thrill in cheap ones Asimov,
you know?

You do better as a thief,
bounty boy.

Now hand it over.

Glad too.

I have to pay you back,
don't I?

You trust your eyes too much,
Asimov!

You're not a chameleon,
you know!

You can't see everywhere at once!

Let's go!

Over there!

Follow him!

What the hell ...

Don't move!

I don't want to hurt you!

IDIOT!

If we lose these things, we're fragged!
Do you understand?

How you doing, kid?

Rotten, you're late, Jet!

Huh?

Damn!

Asimov.

Stop it please!
That stuff is going to kill you!

- NO!
- Ahh!

We'll never get out of here now...

I'll never see Mars...

Adios...

Hey, Spike, get it while it's hot, buddy!

Huh?

It's ready.

What is it?

SPECIAL "Bell Peppers in Beef".

(Spike) Next week we're totally
changing gears...

(Jet) What's the story?

(Spike) House pets wreak havoc
throughout the stars.

(Jet) What?

(Spike) And no, the guy who talks to animals
will not make an appearance.

But anyone who loves animals should
gather around and watch this show.

(Jet) Hey, can we say stuff like that?

I'm taking no responsibility for this.

(Spike)Caution: small children should
sit far back from the TV.

(Jet) Come on,
how far back?

(Spike) About three quarters of a mile.

(Jet) That's too far!

(Spike) Okay, half a mile.
