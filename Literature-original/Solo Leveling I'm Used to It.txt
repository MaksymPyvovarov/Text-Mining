Captain, we should support them too.

You know it's futile, don't you?

Our conventional weapons
can't harm those things.

We can only leave it to those hunters.

Engage individually!

If this place is breached,
our lines will collapse!

Don't retreat!

No. I can't.

This isn't an opponent we can handle.

Damn it.

I'm about to lose consciousness...

Is it healing magic?

Incredible.

My wound healed in an instant.

Look... Look out!

Byung-gu, get down!

Yoonho!

Leave it to me.

S-rank hunters.

S-rank hunters are here.

You're too far ahead, Byung-gu.

I'm sorry.

I wanted to save more people.

Moreover, I believe
that you two will protect me.

It doesn't look like the boss.

It must be the leader of these monsters.

Byung-gu, take care of the wounded.

Leave it to me, Yoonho.

Let's go, Eunseok!

Understood.

Take this!

You brute.

What?

It doesn't seem to be the leader either.

Interesting.

Looks like they made it in time.

Well then,

let's begin.

Mr. Choi, we're ready.

All right.

Let's attack now!

More than a decade ago,

portals that could connect
to a different dimension

suddenly appeared in the world.

Various monsters and magic beasts
reside within the portal.

Conventional weapons can't fight them.

Only those with awakened
special abilities are able to fight them.

They are called hunters.

Based on their magical powers,

hunters are classified
as ones of S, A, B, C, D, E and rank.

However, once awakened,
no matter how hard they try,

their abilities will
no longer be developed.

Good luck with today's raid mission.

Thank you.

Hey, Kim.

- Long time no see.
- What?

Park? What brings you here?

I thought you quit being a hunter.

My wife is pregnant with our second child.

I see.

We can make a lot of money
if the raid mission is successful.

But I'm very worried.

I don't know if I can keep up
with you all after my hiatus.

I'm not very strong as well.

Is that Sung?

Good morning, Sung.

It must be tough in cold weather.

Nice to see you today.

Hey, Sung.

Have you been eating properly?

Yes. I have been eating properly.

Who is he? Is he strong?

Why is everyone greeting him?

It's actually the opposite.

He joined us after you left.

That kid has a nickname,
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

The weakest? Not the strongest?

The weakest.

He was even injured
in an E-rank dungeon and hospitalized.

He's probably the weakest hunter.

Really? He's that weak?

So, calling that kid here
means this mission is easy.

I see.

Don't let him hear this.

Let's end this topic.

I heard everything.

But,

what he said is true. I can't deny it.

Jinwoo, why are you injured again?

Joohee.

We're going on a mission together again.

More importantly,
what happened to your face?

Well... Just the usual.

Be more careful.

I heard you ended up in the hospital.

I was the only one that got injured
in the E-rank dungeon.

There was no healer in your team?

The others are all high-ranked hunters,
so they didn't need a healer.

How could they?

There could be other people who need one.

It's okay. I'm just too weak.

You must know this too.

I'm already used to it.

Looks like we're about to go in.

Let's go.

I would like to propose that
I'll be the captain of this raid mission.

My name is Song Chiyul.

Nice to meet you all.

Of course.

You are the highest-ranked
hunter among us.

I'm relieved to have you lead the team.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Song.

All right.

Is everyone ready?

Let's go in.

Sung.

Stick close to us and don't get hurt.

Okay.

Let's do our job well.

A small knife with little magic power.

With my income,
I can only afford this knife.

But it's better than nothing.

I must perform well today.

Thank you for your hard work,
President Go.

How was your meeting with the government?

They always say the same thing.

They want us to avoid Dungeon Break.

And they demand us to stably supply
the goods acquired from the dungeon.

There's nothing wrong with their requests.

We make a living by reselling goods
acquired from the dungeon.

The crystals obtained
from slain magic beasts

are known as the magic gems.

They can be sold for money.

I did it.

I finally got the first...

Jinwoo!

Jinwoo!

Joohee, back off.

Take this!

I'll defeat the next magic beast.

Joohee, you go heal Sung.

Okay!

It's fine.

I'll definitely heal you.

The magic gems obtained
from high-rank magic beasts

can be made into more powerful weapons
to defeat stronger magic beasts.

Although the mana crystals harvested
from the dungeon can also be weapons,

their effects are not as good
as those of magic gems.

But the requirement of the government...

They want to use them
as a new type of energy.

It is safer than nuclear power,

and more efficient than hydropower,
wind power, and geothermal power.

It causes less air pollution
than thermal power.

So, it's the ideal green energy.

The government is researching
how to generate electricity

using magic gems and mana crystals.

It can only be realized through
rare resources acquired by hunters.

Therefore, the hunters are
particularly important.

- Great!
- We did it!

We defeated the dungeon boss.

- Nice!
- Mr. Song really is amazing.

- We succeeded.
- Yeah!

Jinwoo.

Did you choose
to be a hunter out of pique?

Something will happen to you someday.

Not only your stomach, your whole body
will sustain significant injury.

I'm sorry.

I don't want an apology.

I'm worried about you.

Everyone, did you get your spoils?

We got most of them.

There aren't many mana crystal veins here.

We can't make much money.

Is it over?

I only got this E-rank magic gem.

It's not worth risking my life for this.

Hey!

Everyone, come over here!

Is it a cave?

Or a tunnel?

It seems that the cave is quite deep.

A double dungeon?

I've heard of it.

After all, we have defeated the boss,
but the dungeon is not closing.

Right, I find it odd too.

So, it means...

Right.

There are more quarries
deep within this cave.

Listen to me.

Usually, in such a situation,

we should report to Hunters Association
and follow instructions.

Wait a minute, Song.

Doesn't that mean giving up quarries
to the hunters coming after us?

It's just a D-rank dungeon. It's okay.

His wife is pregnant
with their second child,

and there are so few mana crystals here.

It should be okay to give some slack,

right?

I can understand how you feel.

But it's also true that
there are unknown dangers.

Let's vote on it.

I don't want to go.

Let's go.

I object.

Object.

- Let's go check it out.
- I feel the same.

- Right.
- We should go back.

- I'm going.
- Of course, I will go.

Sorry... I don't want to go.

It's 6 votes in favor
and 6 votes against it.

Only Sung hasn't voted. What do you think?

I...

I understand how dangerous
a D-rank dungeon is for me.

But...

With my father missing,

I'm the only one
in the family who can earn money.

My mother has medical expenses.

My sister has to go to college.

So, I need money.

I'm going.

Then please place your hand
on the black crystal.

Next one, please.

Are you a C-rank hunter?

Then please join our association.

These are the contract terms
of our association.

Here are descriptions of work conditions.

Right, one B-rank hunter and two C-rank
hunters have agreed to sign with us.

Everything is going smoothly, Mr. Choi.

Very good.

Regardless of gender or age,

recruit anyone with talent.

But I don't think any talent is stronger
than Cha Hae-In of our association.

Someone catch them!

Move...

Move! Do you want to get hit?

- I...
- Here it is.

Thank you!

- It's Cha Hae-In!
- Thank you!

Cha Hae-In!

That S-rank hunter?

- Awesome!
- It's her!

So cute.

- I'm your fan.
- I...

- Can you shake my hand?
- I...

Amazing!

That's an S-rank hunter's ability.

How long have we been walking
after entering the cave?

About 40 minutes.

The portal will close in an hour
after the boss is defeated.

So we have 20 minutes.

I'm sorry.

Why are you apologizing?

My vote forced you to come in too.

I'm okay.

Don't worry.

Are you really okay?

How could I possibly

be okay?!

Did you forget?

Jinwoo, if you had been stabbed
a little higher, you would have died.

And I barely managed
to heal your hands and feet.

Are you crazy?

Are you out of your mind?

Tell me.

I'm sorry.

That's right.

Thanks to the B-rank healer Joohee,
I was able to survive every time.

Are you truly reflecting?

Yes.

Well, you can apologize
by treating me to a meal next time.

What?

What? You don't like eating with me?

No... How could that be?

We've arrived.

It's the boss room.

It's rare to see rooms
with doors like this.

It feels a bit weird.

Right.

I'm going in.

I can't go back empty-handed.

That's right. I'm going too.

We shall advance and retreat together.

Is that right, Captain Song?

Right.

Hello, everyone.

I'm Go Gunhee, the president
of the Hunters Association.

I suppose some among you

will become hunters in the future,
while others will not.

The portal has existed
for more than ten years.

There are still many mysteries
unsolved in the dungeon.

Being a hunter is
a life-threatening profession.

Even if you've gotten
used to raid missions,

you can't let your guard down.

Don't be arrogant and contemptuous.

If you want to survive,
there's only one key point.

That is to be more cautious.

The fire started.

Nice atmosphere.

This is my first time
visiting this kind of dungeon.

What's going on with these statues?

They seem to be century-old ones.

Some of them are holding
musical instruments.

Only this statue is particularly large.

It is indeed very large.

What is this?

It feels quite eerie.

Speaking of which,
where is the magic beast?

That's right.

There's not a single one.

What is this? A magic circle?

Mr. Song, something is written here!

Is this ancient language?

Let me see.

"The Commandments of the Cartenon Temple."

"First, worship the God."

- "Second, praise the God."
- Jinwoo...

"Third, believe in God..."

The eyes of that large statue just moved.

It was looking at us.

What?

- "Those who do not obey..."
- How can it? You saw it wrong.

"...will not be able
to leave this place alive."

Look. The door is closed.

What? How come?

Are we trapped here?

That's why I didn't want to come!

This happened because
you underestimated the dungeon!

We never should have
come here in the first place.

I'm going back.

You guys can have all the treasures.

Goodbye.

Get out of there!

No!

- No way.
- It moved!

Are we going to fight that?

What is the rank
of the person who just got killed?

D-rank?

He was definitely stronger
than an E-rank hunter like me.

But he got killed in a blink of an eye.

This is strange.

Isn't this a D-rank dungeon?

How could such a creature be here?

If the statue can move...

Could it be...

I have been through
many life-and-death situations.

I got separated from the team
and was attacked in my first raid mission.

I was injured by an E-rank magic beast
and hospitalized for several weeks.

I also almost starved to death
when I was trapped in a maze.

Even a low-rank dungeon

is a life-and-death mission for me.

Hunters spend the money earned
from magic gems on buying more weapons,

in order to defeat stronger magic beasts

and get higher rewards.

However, I have nothing more
than a cheap little knife.

If it gets damaged, I have to face
the magic beast bare-handed.

These shoes are also worn out.

And it goes on and on.

I endure the ridicule of others.

I do this dangerous job
that doesn't earn much.

In order to survive, I must
constantly look for loopholes.

I have to carefully observe
everything around me.

Maybe that's why

I know so well...

Get down!

Is this a joke?

How could this happen?

What happened?

How would I know?

- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

And you?

I'm fine too.

Don't...

What happened?

How did it end up like this?

We're trapped, and there's no way out.

I'm going to die.

I'll be killed.
