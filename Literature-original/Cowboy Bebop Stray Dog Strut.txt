( Tank by The Seatbelts )

I think it's time to blow this thing

Get everybody and their stuff together,

Okay, 3..2..1..
Let's JAM!

Come on out!

You can't run anymore!

We'll shoot!

It's all over,
Abdul Hakim!

Wanna fight?

You're crazy...

HI AMIGOS !

All 300,000 bounty hunters in the Star
system, how are you doing?

Now it's time for BIGSHOT, the show that
tells all about fugitives!

Shucks, howdy!
Up first today is...

...this hombre. Abdul Hakim.
A notorious serial pet thief ...

In his latest crime spree, Hakim
nabbed an innocent lab animal...

... a research facility,
and he still is on the loose.

And the good news is that he's
worth a whopping 8 million woolong!

The terms are standard ...

You must bring this fugitive in alive
and undamaged.

If you kill him,
kiss the reward good-bye.

This is the biggest reward this season.
So, go out and get him buckaroos.!

Well?

It's history.

Man... everything is broken
around this place.

Hey!

Yo Doc, you got something?

Yeah, on Abdul Hakim.

I'll take it!

300 woolongs,
that's a discount.

I got his face post-plastic surgery.

I'm low on cash, Doc,
can you shave it?

All right, 280.

But only if you make me a solemn promise..

Like what?

Punch him out for me!

He trampled me when
he ripped off my lab.

Give him the once over.
In fact do it twice.

I've got the goods,
if you know what I mean.

This one sure fire winner...

I'll see you in about six hours.

Doc:
His carrying case was very distinct.

Spike:
This info is no extra charge, right?

Oh, all right then.

The case was big enough to
carry a small person inside.

Or a treasure.

Can't really say.

The way he handled it, it seem he had
something special on his mind.

Ni-lai-la!

If you feel run down have
some ginseng hei-sui.

It will keep you up all week!

If you're out of work?
Try sugarcane hei-sui.

Ate too much?
Have pineapple hei-sui.

Gimme some lao-chu.

Moment Ti.

Here you go.

Sorry there, bro.
A little slip you know.

Hey, I said I'm sorry!

Oh, you think you're too good to
talk to me. Is that it?

Hey, what's your problem?
You want a fight or something?

Here,
it's my treat.

Drink it.

Let's see what kind of loot I got.

(Dog growling)

Even if I overhaul this whole ship,
I'll still have some cash left over. ...

At least for some ...
Peking Duck?

Don't count your chickens, Spike.
Or should I say "Don't count your ducks"?

I've got this one nailed!

Take your best shot, dude.

So all three of them went down, eh?

Seems that way.

And Hakim is still out there, eh?

Seems that way.

Dammit, he has no idea
what that thing is worth.

A pet shop?
What kind?

The shady kind.

Listen, bro, here's the deal. You can buy
anything here on Mars.

From guns to human lives.

And of course choice information
can be purchased as well.

So, if you wanna know something,
let me see some cash..

Long chain on this one.

"Way of the Dragon" model?

Hey, pretty good eye!

That's a rare one from
back in the mid '30s!

Yeah, it's an antique for sure.

Try a store called "Animal Treasure" off
Caiphon Road pass the Cyber Mall.

Pretty sure you'll find
what you're looking for.

I'll look, but that's all... I'm not promising
to buy it, until I've seen it.

Right, fine.

Did you run out of funds from
all the plastic surgery, Hakim?

You've got it all wrong.
I'm not...

Don't move.

Pretty slippery the way you change
your face around.

But you're not slipping out on me.

What ...?

Now both of you stop this funny business.

My babies are very sensitive, please!

Open the case.

Why me...!?

This is a misunderstanding...

Do it!

Alright, I'll open it.

A Welsh Corgi. They're very sweet,
but you see them everywhere.

I'm afraid they're hardly a rare breed.

Well, how much is it worth?
I mean ...?

You could sell him for about 2...

200?

No no, 2 woolongs.

- No way!
- Yes way

And if you don't like it, take it back
and eat the poor thing.

It IS just a puppy...

Sorry about the gun thing.
Have a nice day, huh!

Really didn't want that
Peking Duck anyway.

At least give me 200...

Sorry.

150?

No can do.

120!

ZERO.
I'll take it back.

Not again!

What now?

My babies are all running away!
Somebody help!

- There it is!
- All right!

Huh?
That was Hakim!?

What's the hell's going
on around here!?

("I Want It All Back"
by Mai Yamane)

"You said you wanted to see PARIS

"So I took you to the movie
'Bon Amie' or something french like that

"And then you said you were embarrassed

"Because I never bought you jewelry
Television shopping fixed all that"

"Funny thing

" 'Cause I haven't seen you lately

"When I called your house
It wasn't you who told me ..."

"I heard it alllllll
from your dad

"I used up all my money on you BABY
and I want it back"

So, are you a bounty hunter?

Or some animal rights chump?

You really make me laugh, Hakim.

Risking your life on a dog that's only
worth a fistful of woolong.

What's it to you?

Nothing but a giggle. But you're worth
a barrel full of woolong my friend.

"I couldn't take you to Miami

"But I took you to the ocean and we
Had some blue Hawaii on the beach"

Not bad, Hakim.

What!?

Dammit!

Ah, shuddup!

I'm not in a great mood right now, alright!

Here you go.
A nice little collar, alright?

Got a dog instead of a duck, huh?

Yeah right,
what do you got?

Well, I've got plenty...

This is a Welsh Corgi.
100% mongrel.

100 percent?

Yeah, right.
That's all the percents there are.

Shit, this whole thing gives
me a headache.

And all this is
because of this worthless mutt...

The dog is worthless, Spike,
but the OWNER is worth a fortune.

Yeah, think about it. And try to make
friends with the pooch, would ya?

I hate kids and pets!

They're all a royal pain in the butt!

I've got something!

Woe, it's big!

It's big!

Here it comes!

Pull it in, come on!

What time is it?

I-l-lt's 4 o'clock,
right on the button.

Just two more hours...

Who was that running with Hakim?
One of his boys?

Seems that way.

We have no clues?
We've got to find it.

If it falls into police hands,
we're in very deep shit.

Seems that way.

All that work,
the experiments.

It will all be for nothing
if this gets out in the open.

Seems that way.

He has no idea how blood and sweat we
put into that "data dog".

Why don't YOU do this part of it?

Complaining again.
Didn't your grandmother ...

ever tell you good boy has to finish
what he starts?

My grandmother died
before I was born.

"My condolences. We've got our guy
exactly were we want him."

For once, just stick to the plan..

Code name "snoop."
Put me through.

It's me.

Yeah, I had a little trouble.

No, it's nothing I can't handle...

Stop, Michael!
Come back, come on!

I need to reschedule the
meeting one more day.

No, it wasn't a big deal.
I just ...

What do you mean, impossible?

Why? Hey, wait a minute!

Really great plan here, Jet.

Hey, you!

There is something you are looking for.
Something you need to fine.

Wait, don't go!

My little Peeko can help you
find the object of your search!

Yes, my little Peeko knows all about it.

Well, do you want to know where it is
or not? Time is running out, my friend.

Good dog, where ever you go,
Hakim will follow.

Yeah, and I'll be tracking every move.

That's right,
it's dog eat dog.

We have no choice.
We have to use... a dog whistle.

You know what that could mean.
It's very risky.

I don't care.

It will draw attention!

It's our only option.

We're ready to go.

Then do it.

Is it on?
I can't hear it..

It's too high pitched.
Only animals can pick it up....

I knew that.
I was testing you..

Well... Here's another great moment
in the legend of Spike.

Famous bounty hunter
and dog walker.

It's the moving card.
What you're looking for is about to move.

What's the matter?
Something is upsetting my babies!

Hey, wait!
Come back!

Jet, he got away!

Huh? You mean Hakim?

The DOG!

It's close, very it's close!
What you are looking for is drawing near.

In fact, it is here,
it is right here!

Wait a minute,
my money!

I'll pay you when I'm rich!

Not again...

What the hell!
Has every dog gone crazy or what?

Are you happy, dear?

Everything's perfect.

- Excuse me...
- Ow!

What the devil do you think
you're doing?

Hakim!

Dammit!

It's time for a dog nap.

Hakim!

Spike, he's headed for the causeway.

Trying to outrun me, huh!

I don't think so!

Now, don't get too hotheaded
Spike!

You haven't seen hotheaded yet,
Jet!

There's our man!

Payback time, Hakim!

Hey, back off!
This pooch snatcher is MINE!

What the?

Get him!

Get off!

SHIT!

THIS is why I hate pets!

HIYA AMIGOS!

All you 300,000 bounty hunters in this
Star system, how ya doing?

Now it's time for BIGSHOT, the show that
talks all about fugitives!

Shucks, howdy!
The big news is of Abdul Hakim...

...which chose a flashy way to turn
himself in last week.

Mum hum!
He sure did!

Before his crimes spree came crashing down,
he stole a mysterious "data dog"...

...which was developed in an illegal
research lab.

Woe! What is a "data dog"?

If I told you that, I would have to kill you.
But seriously, that information is classified.

Though we do know it's a canny canine.
Collectors will pay a fortune for it.

Wow, fancy that! A genius hound dog!
I would like to own a dog like that!

I'm afraid this one disappeared
without a trace.

Another mystery.
Where did it go?

No one knows!

But shucks howdy,
it's time for a commercial!

I doubt it...

You keep mopping! And when you're
done, feed the komodo dragons!

Watch your fingers!

I'm going to work your butt off!.

Hey!

Get down.
No dogs on the table!

That's cold!

That's why I said I didn't want any
stray mongrel mutts in here!

But you're the one
who brought him here!

Anyway, we got to do
something about the ticks.

Ticks now...

Let's just salt him
and eat him!

Time to hit the road.
See you next time!

So long for now!!

You're welcome.

( The Real Folk Blues by Yoko Kanno )

Aishiteta to nageku niwa
Too much time has passed by to

Amarinimo toki wa sugitte shimatta
Lament that we were deeply in love

Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart

Iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
Cannot heal all the tears in it

Kawaita hitomi de dare ka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes

The real folk blues!

Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is

Doro no kawa ni tsukatta
Sitting in muddy water

Jinsei mo waruku wa nai
Isn't such a bad life

Ichido kiri de owaru nara
If it ends after the first time

Faye:
Show no mercy.

When it comes to high rollers,
that's the way the game is played.

The bell tolls even for the great ones.
For they too must fall one day.

Money makes the world go around.

But before you know it, you could be
buried under a mountain of debt.

Wandering through the
far flung regions of space.

That's where I met a cowboy.

A star dust session,
played in a off key melody.

Honky Tonk Woman.
